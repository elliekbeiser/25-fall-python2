    "The centroid of a polygon is the point whose x-coordinate (resp., y-coordinate) is the average of all the x-coordinates (resp., y-coordinates) of the polygon. Write a method for the Polygon class called centroid that returns the centroid of self as a Point object. Note that this method needs to work on a Polygon of any size, since it will be inherited by Triangle and Quadrilateral.\n",
    "The perimeter of a polygon is the sum of the lengths of its sides. Write a method for the Polygon class called perimeter that returns the perimeter of self. Note that this method needs to work on a Polygon of any size, since it will be inherited by Triangle and Quadrilateral. You may assume the list of Points are in consecutive order. Make use of your distance function from the previous assignment to help you compute the perimeter.\n",
    "A polygon is regular if all its sides have the same length. Write a method for the Polygon class called is_regular that returns True if self is regular and false otherwise. Note that this method needs to work on a Polygon of any size, since it will be inherited by Triangle and Quadrilateral. You may assume the list of Points are in consecutive order. Make use of your distance function from the previous assignment to help you determine whether the polygon is regular.\n",
